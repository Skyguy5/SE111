            <b><i><u>My name is Skyler Perry. I have horrible procrastination issues and I like to pretend I'm awake in class even though I'm not even in the right class. I am bozo the clown central but at least I know how to make a website now and how URL paths are divided and the difference between URI's and URL's. I enjoy gazing at clouds and the night sky, petting my cat Toby and working on my desktop computer.</u></i></b>
